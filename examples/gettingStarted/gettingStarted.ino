// Simple code to get started with the YouMakeRobots class
// Connect servo-motors to pin 22, 23, ... 53 of the Arduino MEGA board
// The serial monitor of the Arduino IDE can be used to control them.
// Select a speed of 115200 bauds in the serial monitor.
//
// To move a servo, type "MOVE:<servoId>=<angle>" in the serial monitor
// - <servoId> is the servo id between 0 and 31 included. 
//   0 corresponds to the servo connected to pin 22 and 31 corresponds to
//   the servo connected to pin 53.
// - <angle> is the target angle in degrees, between -90 and +90 included.
//   An increasing angle makes the servo to rotate clockwise, while a 
//   decreasing angle makes the servo to rotate counter-clockwise.
//
// For example, to move the servo connect to pin 22 to +45 degrees, type
// "MOVE:0=45" without the ""
// It is possible to move multiple servos at the same time. 
// For example, to move the first 8 servos to 0 degrees, type
// "MOVE:0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=0,5=0,6=0,7=0" without the ""
// 
// Other commands are available. To see an up to date list of available commands,
// refer to method executeCommand in YouMakeRobots.cpp
//
// For example, "SPEED:1000" makes all moves last 1000 ms. If you want your robot
// to move faster, try "SPEED:200".
// Another useful command is TRIM, which allows to "trim" / adjust the center of each servo.
// by adding a constant offset in us to all commanded pulse widths of this servo.
// Try for example "TRIM:0=40" or "TRIM:0=-40" to offset the center of the servo 
// connected to pin 22 (servo 0) by +40us or -40us.
