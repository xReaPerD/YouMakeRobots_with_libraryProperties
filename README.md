# YouMakeRobots
Arduino library to control #YouMakeRobots robots

# Installation

To install this library, just create a YouMakeRobots sub-folder in your Arduino\libraries folder.
On Windows and Macintosh machines, the Arduino\libraries folder is typically located in your Documents folder.
On Linux machines, the Arduino\libraries folder is typically located in your home directory.


When installed, this library should look like:

* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\examples
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\LICENSE
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\MotionProfile.cpp
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\MotionProfile.h
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\README.md   (this file)
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\YouMakeRobots.cpp
* Arduino\librairies\YouMakeRobots\YouMakeRobots.h


# Usage

After this library is installed, you just have to start the Arduino IDE.

To use this library in a sketch, go to the Sketch | Import Library menu and
select YouMakeRobots.  This will add a corresponding line to the top of your sketch:
#include <YouMakeRobots.h>

To stop using this library, delete that line from your sketch.
